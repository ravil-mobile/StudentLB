To run StudentLB on the Linux cluster, please execute the following:

1) go to the StudetnLB root folder
2) load the following modules manually:

	module unload mpi.intel
	module load python
	module load gcc/7
	module load mpi.ompi/2.0

3) run the script: 
	
	./run.sh

4) IF YOU WANT TO MEASURE PERFORMANCE, PLEASE, DO THE FOLLOWING:

	4.1) go to the Code directory
			cd <folder>/StudentLB/Code

	4.2) open the Makefile in a text editor
			vim Makefile

	4.3) comment the current variable MODE and
