1. If you are not able to run run.sh script, please, check wheter
   you have permission to run the script on your system
   POSSIBLE SOLUTION: chmod 775 <folder>/StudentLB/run.sh 


2. Be sure that your polyMesh folder (which should be in the root directory)
   contains the follwing files in case if you don't have LBM mesh:
   "owner", "boundary", "nieghbour", "points", "faces"

   EXAMPLE:
	   	ls <folder>/polyMesh/
			boundary
			faces
			neighbour
			owner
			points


3. If you get the error with the mesh conversion then you can do following:
   3.1 open the "owner" file in the polyMesh folder
   3.2 look at the FoamFile header
   3.3 add space between "nCells:" and the actual cell number
   
   EXAMPLE:
   ORIGINE:
   note        "nPoints:148745  nCells:112734  nFaces:372179  nInternalFaces:304225";

   CHANGE TO:
   note        "nPoints:148745  nCells: 112734  nFaces:372179  nInternalFaces:304225";	
   									         ^

4. Please be sure that metis (gpmetis) was installed on your system
   HINT: Sometimes you have to download and compile metis on your system explicitly
